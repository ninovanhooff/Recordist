# Recordist
The Filmmaker's audio recorder.

This app uses
[Phonograph](https://github.com/ninovanhooff/Phonograph)
as a recording backend.

## Work in Progress
Recordist really is a tech demo at this moment. The interface is not
much too look at; mostly a Proof Of Concept for features such as live
monitoring and audio scopes.
